Desenvolvimento de software orientado a dados: uma visão geral educacional


## Introduction

Data-Driven Software Development (DDSD) is a modern approach to software development that emphasizes the use of data to guide decision-making processes. This approach is based on the principle that data, when properly collected, analyzed, and interpreted, can provide valuable insights that can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of software development processes. It involves the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or Objectives And Key Results (OKRs) to provide clear, objective, and measurable outcomes. This approach is fundamental in building profitable products by finding ways to reduce costs and improve efficiency.

## Relational and Non-Relational Databases

In the context of DDSD, data is typically stored in databases, which can be either relational or non-relational. 

Relational databases, or SQL databases, such as MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server, are based on the relational model - store data in a tabular format - which organizes data into tables with rows and columns. The columns contain data attributes, and the rows have data values. They are vertically scalable, meaning they can handle increasing loads by adding more resources to a single server. These databases are ideal for applications that require complex queries, transactional integrity, and strong consistency.

On the other hand, non-relational databases, sometimes referred to as NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, such as MongoDB, Cassandra, and CouchDB, are designed for scalability and high performance because of that they do not use the tables, fields, and columns structured data model. Instead, they store data in a format that is best for the type of data they are handling. This could be a hierarchical structure, a graph, or a document-oriented structure. Non-relational databases are horizontally scalable, meaning they handle more traffic by adding more servers to the database. They are ideal for applications that require flexibility, scalability, and the ability to handle large volumes of data and complex data types.

## Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and Data Access Frameworks

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that creates a "bridge" between object-oriented programs and, in most cases, relational databases. ORM simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to use familiar Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It uses metadata descriptors to create a layer between the programming language and a relational database, helping programmers work with databases using their preferred programming language. ORM frameworks, such as Hibernate, Entity Framework, and Sequelize, abstract the underlying database system, allowing developers to interact with the database using the programming language of the application, rather than SQL.

Data access frameworks, such as Spring Data and MyBatis, provide a more flexible approach to data access, allowing developers to write custom SQL queries when necessary, while still providing a high-level API for common data access tasks.

Frameworks like Hibernate, Java Persistence API (JPA), and Java Data Objects (JDO) support ORM. For instance, in the .NET ecosystem, Entity Framework is a popular ORM that simplifies mapping between objects in software to the tables and columns in a relational database.

## Benefits of Data-Driven Software Development

Data-driven software development offers numerous benefits that can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of software development processes. Here are some of the key benefits:

1. **Visibility and Accountability:** A robust data-driven development approach provides benchmarks for added visibility of current development efforts. Thus, development teams can easily visualize the impact of their work as it ties to the success of the company’s overall business metrics. This leaves teams with clear and concise data points to measure individual and collective success.

2. **Accelerated Time-to-Market:** Data-driven development helps reduce the time involved in a project and accelerates the time-to-market of a software release, which is a vital component of any organization’s competitive advantages.

3. **Problem-Solving Environment:** Data-driven development germinates a proficient, proactive, agile, problem-solving environment that allows development units to quickly fix short and long-term setbacks. 

4. **Continuous Improvement and Quicker Decision-Making:** Data-driven software development is an enabler of continuous improvement and quicker decision-making. With the help of data, development teams gain access to valuable and actionable insights that can effectively help reduce the time involved in a project, solve routine challenges, streamline continuous improvement, and more.

5. **Big Picture Thinking:** Data-driven development can also help organizations tap into comparative patterns and propensity research of unique outcomes at both the organization and the industry levels. This is what we like to call “big picture” thinking, which helps organizations stay ahead of the curve.

However, it's important to note that data-driven development doesn’t come without its challenges. Oftentimes, organizations struggle to align individual and organizational KPIs and OKRs, failing to accurately measure and track individual and collective contributions. Another challenge of this approach is the actual bulk of the work which can lead to substantial effort, unnecessary delays, or rework during development and deployment. Despite these challenges, the benefits of data-driven development often outweigh the drawbacks, making it a valuable approach for modern software development.

### Main Challenges in Data-Driven Decision Making

1. **Quality of data**: The first challenge in a data-driven project is data discovery. The quality of the datasets is crucial and fundamental. The solution to this challenge is to follow the data quality cycle to improve and ensure high data quality.

2. **Integrating data**: Data integration is the process of combining data from different sources and storing it together to obtain a unified view. Data integration problems are likely to be caused by inconsistent data within an organization. The solution to this issue is to use data integration platforms that can automate and orchestrate transformations, create extensible frameworks, optimize query performance automatically, etc.

3. **Dirty data**: Dirty data is data that contains inaccurate information. It is practically impossible to completely remove it from a dataset. Dirty data can be inaccurate, incorrect, duplicate, inconsistent, incomplete, or violate business rules. The solution to this challenge is to cleanse, validate, replace, and delete raw and unstructured data with the help of data management experts or data cleaning tools.

4. **Uncertainty of data**: Uncertainty can occur for many reasons, including measurement errors, processing errors, etc. When using real-world data, error, and uncertainty should be expected. The solution to this challenge is to use powerful uncertainty quantification and analytics software tools that can simplify simulating, testing, and analyzing complex systems.

5. **Transforming data**: Transforming data from multiple sources that are usually incompatible with each other is a challenge. The data needs to be cleaned and normalized before they can be used together. To gain meaningful insights from data, Data Transformation is essential.

Now, let's find some information about future trends in data-driven decision making.

## Future Trends in Data-Driven Software Development
