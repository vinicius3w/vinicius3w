Before joined to this university, Dr. Garcia worked as a software reuse scientist and consultant at Recife Center for Advanced Studies and Systems ([C.E.S.A.R](http://www.cesar.org.br){:target="\_blank"}), where he conducted several industrial projects focused on the various software reuse aspects, such as methods, processes and tools and was a full member of the SEPG (Software Engineering Process Group) responsible for Productivity in the Software Life Cycle. Besides, he was a software reuse professor at [C.E.S.A.R.EDU](http://www.cesar.edu.br){:target="\_blank"}. In the software productivity efforts, Dr. Garcia has worked as project manager/researcher/scientist involved since the conception solutions until their deployment. He is also the author of more than 70 papers published and presented in conferences on these and other software reuse topics in leading venues worldwide and has served as referee in important journal papers with focus on software reuse such as IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, IEEE Software, Journal of Systems and Software and Information and Software Technology Journal (IST).
